### 🧪 Current Work

🚀 **Rolls-Royce (AI Intern)**  
• Optimized a neural network, reducing model size from 29 GB to 900 MB with minimal accuracy loss, achieving a
97% efficiency gain through architectural restructuring.

• Accelerated a temperature prediction pipeline by rewriting the Python script using PyTorch tensors with CUDA
integration, reducing execution time from 2 hours to under 3 minutes while maintaining predictive accuracy.

• Engineered a time series segmentation tool in Python to classify steady vs. unsteady states, apply value-based
binning, and compute dwell times for temporal pattern analysis.

• Designed a thermal prediction algorithm integrating Lumped Mass Modeling, Physics-Based Scaling, and
Logistic Functions to estimate node temperatures in a TTC engine.

• Achieved predictive accuracy within 5–6°C, significantly reducing dependency on time-consuming simulations
and enhancing computational efficiency in thermal modeling workflows.

• Developed a Python algorithm to detect and classify jumps in transient time series data, calculating jump
durations and class segments to support fatigue analysis of TTC engines.
